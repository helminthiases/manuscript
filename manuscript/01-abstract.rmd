Soil transmitted helminths (STH), i.e., geohelminths, are parasitic intestinal worms that cause intestinal nematode infections (INI).  According to the Lancet's 2019 global burden of disease study INI - comprising *ascariasis*, *trichuriasis*, and *hookworm disease* - are the most prevalent of the neglected tropical diseases.  Additionally, INI are the second most burdensome neglected tropical diseases, after dengue.

... the investigation suggests that

The explanatory models suggest a non-linear association between that piped sewage facilities access and *Hookworm disease* prevalence.  Up to a certain point - approximately $24\%$ access -  as the percentage of inhabitants that have access to piped sewage facilities increases *Hookworm disease* prevalence odds declines.  Beyond the $24\%$ access point, *Hookworm disease* prevalence odds start increasing with increasing access percentage.  The increasing prevalence odds at this inflection point might due to a mix of access density & poor maintenance.  The piped sewage facilities access percentage is the percentage of an areaâ€™s inhabitants that have access to piped sewage facilities. The measure does not give an insight into access density, i.e., the median number of people per piped [defaecation] facility. Defaecation facilities that have high access densities might not be well-maintained.
