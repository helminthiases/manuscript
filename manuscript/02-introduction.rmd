Soil transmitted helminths (STH), or geohelminths, are parasitic intestinal worms that cause intestinal nematode infections (INI) such as ascariasis, trichuriasis, and hookworm disease.  According to the Lancet's latest global burden of disease study [@Lancet2020, @IHME2020] , intestinal nematode infections are amongst the most burdensome neglected tropical diseases, and the most prevalent of the diseases

Therefore, geohelminths infections are a focus of the World Health Organization (WHO).  Geohelminths infections prevention, control, and elimination activities depend on knowledge of prevalence [@Montresor2011], and prevalence metrics depend on field surveys, which are rather expensive to conduct.  They are especially expensive when there are no measures to systematically/strategically direct field scientists to survey areas.  In the absence of systematic/strategic direction, the field scientists have to survey as wide an area as possible, albeit subject to financial, accessibility, etc., constraints.

An option, in place of expensive field surveys, is geohelminths infections predictions.  However, prediction model development depends on probable risk factors knowledge & understanding [@Murray2020].   A key geohelminths infections prevalence hypothesis, of WHO experts, is that WaSH (water, sanitation, and hygiene) variables might be critical risk factors.

Hence, the project investigates the possibility that one or more WaSH variables are geohelminths infections risk factors that may aid geohelminths infections prevalence prediction.


## *Project Aim*

Understanding the association between geohelminths infections prevalence and WaSH (water, sanitation, and hygiene) variables, and their effect, or otherwise, on geohelminths infections prevalence prediction.

## *Project Objectives*

Hence, the project's objectives are to

> 1. Understand the association between geohelminths infections prevalence and WaSH (water, sanitation, and hygiene) variables.
>
> 2. Determine the extent to which WaSH variables aid STH prevalence prediction

via geostatistical models.
