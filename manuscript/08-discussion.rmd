# *DISCUSSION* \label{chapter:discussion}

This project studies the association between WaSH variables and geohelminths infections prevalence.  It especially focuses on *Hookwookworm* disease prevalence, and investigates whether one or more WaSH variables are geohelminths infections prevalence risk factors.  The investigation is via explanatory Binomial geostatistical logistic models.

The resulting model suggests that *piped sewage facilities access* is a statistically significant risk factor.  The model illustrates a non-linear relationship between *piped sewage facilities access* and *Hookworm disease infections prevalence*.  As the percentage of inhabitants that have access to piped sewage facilities increases from $0$ to approximately $`r round(-100*0.5*CPL/CPQ, digits = 2)`\%$ *Hookworm disease* prevalence odds decline.  However, beyond the $`r round(-100*0.5*CPL/CPQ, digits = 2)`\%$ access point *Hookworm disease* prevalence odds start increasing with increasing access percentage.

The increasing prevalence odds after the $`r round(-100*0.5*CPL/CPQ, digits = 2)`\%$ inflection point might be due to a mix of *access density* & *poor maintenance*.  The piped sewage facilities access percentage is the percentage of an areaâ€™s inhabitants that have access to piped sewage facilities. The measure does not give an insight into access density, i.e., the median number of people per piped [defaecation] facility. Defaecation facilities that have high access densities might not be well-maintained.

## Assumptions

\noindent The key/implicit assumptions:

> * The ESPEN (Expanded Special Project for Elimination Neglected Tropical Diseases) survey measures, when available, are error free.\newline
> * If an ESPEN record's *number of survey examinations* value is zero or null, then the examinations' data is missing.\newline
> * If an ESPEN record's *number of positive tests* value is null, then the positives test data is missing.\newline
> * The WaSH access percentage estimates, and the population density estimates, are approximately accurate.\newline


## Limitations

The assumptions hint at the project's limitations.  The data sets of a number of countries have [missing data cells](https://helminthiases.github.io/data/missing.html#missing-spatiotemporal-data); the critical missing data being geographic co&ouml;rdinates, year, the number of examinations, and the number of positive tests.  In the end, instead of a place agnostic model, the project's models use the data of a single country: Togo.  However, the model can be extended in the future.

\vspace{10pt}

It is quite possible that the accuracy of the WaSH access percentage estimates, and of the population density estimates, varies between and within countries.  Hence, the findings herein should be re-explored via one or more alternative estimates.


## Validity

\noindent Finally, the project's validity (@Trochim2006) can be understood via

> * **Internal Validity**: The project's focus is not the determination of a cause & effect relationship, hence an internal validity valuation is inapplicable.

> * **Construct Validity**: Each explanatory model determines **(a)** whether there is a statistically significant association between an extraneous independent variable and *Hookworm disease* infections prevalence, and subsequently **(b)** the variable's impact.  This is in line with the project's aim & objectives, i.e., the operational setting does reflect the construct.

> * **External Validity**: At present, the study's conclusions can be generalised to Togo only.

> * **Conclusion Validity**: Each of the resulting model's MCML (Monte Carlo Maximum Likelihood) coefficient estimates is statistically significant, additionally a different estimation method - Bayesian parameter estimation - produces similar estimates.  Hence, it is reasonable to conclude that $piped\underline{\hspace{0.1cm}}sewer$ is probably a risk factor. The case would be stronger in the case of a *temporal Binomial geostatistical logistic model*.
