## [Validity](https://conjointly.com/kb/conclusion-validity/)

* Internal Validity [design]: The project's focus is not the determination of a cause & effect relationship, hence an internal validity valuation is inapplicable.

* Construct Validity [measurement]: Each explanatory model determines (a) whether there is a statistically significant association between an extraneous independent variable and *Hookworm disease* infections prevalence, and subsequently (b) the variable's impact.  This is in line with the project's aim, i.e., the operational setting does reflect the construct.

* External Validity [sampling]: The study's conclusions can be generalised to Togo,

* Conclusion Validity [analysis]: ...  hence, it is probably reasonable to conclude that $piped\underline{\hspace{0.1cm}}sewer$ is a plausible prognostic risk factor.
