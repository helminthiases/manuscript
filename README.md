## Potential Structure

#### ABSTRACT

A single paragraph summarising the major aspects of the dissertation.

#### INTRODUCTION

A discussion of

* Motivation/Problem
* Aim
* Objectives
* Manuscript Structure

#### BACKGROUND

A background reading/research discussion of
* Strategies that have guided STH (soil transmitted helminth) field survey area selection.
* Methods for predicting STH prevalence.
* Prediction guided STH field survey area selection.

#### DATA

* The Data Sets
  * Soil Transmitted Helminths Infections Data: Including a section discussing missing data.
  * WASH (water, sanitation, and hygiene) Data
  * Environmental & Climatic Features (MAYBE)
 
* Data Integration

#### EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS

An exploration of the relationships, if any, between historical prevalence values and
* WASH variables.
* any other variables.

#### MODELS

Focusing on two, or more, geo-statistical models.

#### EVALUATION OF MODELS

A comparative evaluation of the developed models, of their results.

#### DISCUSSION

* Validity and relevance to the research problem/question
  * The degree to which the study's conclusions can be generalised to the population. [External Validity, Sampling]
  * Is the operational setting, or are the measures, in line with the hypothesis construct?  [Construct Validity, Measurement]
  * "... the degree to which conclusions we reach about relationships in our data are 
    reasonable"<sup><a href="https://conjointly.com/kb/conclusion-validity/"> 1</a></sup>.  [Conclusion Validity, Analysis]

* Limitations, biases, noise.

* Assumptions.

#### CONCLUSIONS

A reflection.
